<h2><b>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</b></h2>

When writing code, it's important to make it easy to read and understand by using clear and descriptive names for variables and functions, as well as adding comments to explain what the code is doing. Breaking up the code into smaller pieces with specific responsibilities can also make it easier to find and fix bugs or modify the code as needed.

In a recent project, I used a module called CRUD Python to simplify the code that connected a dashboard to a database. By using this module, I could keep the details of the database separate from the dashboard code. This made it easier to make changes to the database without affecting the dashboard, and I could also reuse the module in other projects in the future. One potential future use for this module could be in building web applications, where it could handle the basic database operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. By using the module, it could make building the backend of the application easier and more flexible.


<h2><b>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</b></h2>

To approach a problem as a computer scientist, I typically begin by analyzing the requirements and defining the scope of the project. This helps me to understand the problem and identify the key features that need to be implemented. In the case of the project for the course, I worked to understand the requirements of the project, the functionality required, and the resources available.

To meet the requirements of the project, I used MongoDB to create a document database to store and manage data. I used Python to write a module that implemented the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations required for the project. I also designed a dashboard using Plotly to visualize the data and provide insights to the user.

Compared to other assignments in other courses, this project required me to be more resourceful in identifying solutions to problems. For example, I had to learn how to use MongoDB and implement a document-based database, which was a new experience for me.

In the future, when creating databases to meet other client requests, I would continue to focus on understanding the client's needs and requirements. I would also use my experience with MongoDB and Python to create a scalable, efficient, and maintainable database that can be easily adapted to meet changing needs.


<h2><b>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</b></h2>


As a computer scientist, my primary role is to solve problems using computer-based solutions. This can involve designing and implementing software applications, developing algorithms for data analysis, and creating new technologies to improve efficiency or automate processes. Computer scientists also research new techniques and tools to improve software development and make technology more accessible and useful to people.

In the context of the project for Grazioso Salvare, my work on this type of project could help the company by providing an effective database management system and dashboard that would enable them to easily access and analyze their data. The dashboard would allow them to visualize and understand key performance indicators and make data-driven decisions. The efficient data management system would streamline their work, reducing time and effort needed to manage and analyze the data. The resulting productivity improvements and informed decisions could ultimately translate into better financial performance and customer satisfaction.

In general, computer scientists can help companies to improve their operations, enhance their products and services, and create new technologies that drive innovation and growth. By solving complex problems using computer-based solutions, computer scientists can enable companies to be more efficient, effective, and competitive in their respective industries.
